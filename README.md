```

### State Management

- **Zustand Store**: Centralized state management using Zustand for both posts and chat data
- State is divided into two main domains:
  - `posts`: Manages article data, loading states, and error handling
  - `chat`: Manages conversation messages, loading states, and error handling

### Data Flow

1. **API Layer**: 
   - `api.ts` handles all external data fetching with error handling
   - Fallback to mock data when API is unavailable
   - Relative API paths for deployment flexibility

2. **Component Layer**:
   - Components consume state from Zustand store
   - UI updates based on loading/error states
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adaptive layout based on device size
   - Tab-based navigation on mobile
   - Grid-based layout on desktop

### Technical Implementation
- React with TypeScript for frontend development
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom Apple-inspired design system
- shadcn-ui component library for consistent UI elements
- Responsive layout using CSS grid and flexbox
- Tabs interface for mobile view to switch between news and chat
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Light/dark theme support
